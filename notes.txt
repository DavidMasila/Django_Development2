install django-crispy-forms
install crispy-bootstrap5
django-admin startproject projectname
cd projectname > python manage.py startapp appname

add the main.apps.MainConfig file to installed apps in settings.py in main project folder

add to installed apps "crispy_forms" and "crispy_bootstrap5"

add 
CRISPY_ALLOWED_TEMPLATE_PACKS = "bootstrap5"
CRIPSY_TEMPLATE_PACK = "bootstrap5"
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL  = "/home"
LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = "/login"

create urls.py file in the app that you create:
 include:
    from django.urls import path
    from .views import views

        urlpatters = [
            path('', views.name_of_route, name = "name_of_route")
        ]

on the views:
 we need to create a home route
 def home(request):
    return render(request, 'main/home.html') # render the template here its at main/home.html

we also need to create a login:
    here we used the django.contrib.auth.urls in the urls.py in main app folder
    create a login.html template
        in the login.html 
            {% load crispy_forms_tags%}
        in the block content add form tags 
            {% block content %}
                <form>
                    {% csrf_token %}{{ form|crispy }}
                    <p>Add any other extra infor here</p>
                    <button>Login</button>
                </form>
            {% endblock %}


we also need to have a sign up page that makes use of the model already in django
    we also need to create a template for the sign_up page uses the login style
    create a new file call it forms that should have the forms
        from django.contrib.auth.models import User
        FROM django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm
        from django import forms

        class RegisterForm(UserCreationForm):
            email = forms.EmailField(required = True)

            classMeta:
                model = User
                fields = ["username","email","password1","password2"]


we need to have this form in the views:
 from .forms import RegisterForm
 from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
 from django.contrib.auth import login, logout, authenticate


    def sign_up(request):
        if request.method == "POST":
            #getting 
            form = RegisterForm(request.POST)
            if form.is_valid():
                user = form.save()
                login(request, user)
                return redirect("/home)
        else:
            form = RegisterForm()

        return render(request, 'registration/sign_up.html', {"form": form})

we need to run migration to create the databases  before using login and sign up
 otherwise we gate the error auth_user model doesn't exist
    >> python manage.py migrate
