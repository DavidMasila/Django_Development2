# Django CRUD Project 
This is a small Django CRUD exercise that simulates an application that allows a user to create
employee details in a form, update that on a databse, read the list of employees and delete is they want.

The following screenshots shows the front end of the application.
There are buttons to add, edit and delete and a list view to check all the added employees
